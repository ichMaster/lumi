"""TUI ↔ peripheral bridge helpers (v0.13) — drain the `inbox` FIFO, mirror Лілі's replies to `outbox`.

**No Textual dependency** — pure functions over the file bus (`state.fifo`), so they're unit-testable
without the app. The TUI is the inbox **consumer** (reads new lines on idle → runs each as a turn) and
the outbox **producer** (appends **only Лілі's own replies** — never your input → the bridge is
**echo-free by construction**). The Telegram daemons (v0.13) and later voice/dictation share this bus.
